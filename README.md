# CFC Project - Info Extractor
## Introduction
The main objective of “Info Extractor” is to create a script to gather system information. This project will use multiple commands to dive into the Linux system and gather system information as much as possible.

The information gathered from commands usually contains too much information, making it hard for human eyes to read. Therefore, making the output clean and human-readable is also one of the focuses of this script.

First, the script will gather network information such as public IP address - the address connected to the internet, private IP address - the address in the machine’s network, and MAC address (a.k.a physical address) - the unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment.

Second, it will gather system information such as processes - to determine which process consumes the most CPU resources, services - to collect all installed services on the machine, and memory - to gather the system’s memory usage.

Last but not least, the file system. The script can find the largest file in the system with the proper permissions provided. 

Upon completion of the data collection process, all the gathered information will be meticulously analyzed and synthesized. The results of this analysis will then be compiled into a comprehensive summary, which will be prominently displayed after the script.
